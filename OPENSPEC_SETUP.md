## How to Use OpenSpec for FitDoctor Development

### For Developers

1. **Before Starting Work**
   ```bash
   # Review project context
   cat openspec/project.md
   
   # Check existing specs
   openspec list --specs
   
   # Review relevant specifications
   openspec spec show fitdoctor-web-app
   ```

2. **When Adding Features**
   ```bash
   # View active change proposals
   openspec list
   
   # Review the proposal
   openspec show enhance-fitdoctor-features
   
   # Check implementation tasks
   cat openspec/changes/enhance-fitdoctor-features/tasks.md
   ```

3. **After Completing Work**
   ```bash
   # Archive the change (updates main specs)
   openspec archive enhance-fitdoctor-features
   ```

### For AI Assistants (Claude, Cursor, etc.)

1. **Initial Context Loading**
   ```
   Please read openspec/project.md to understand the FitDoctor 
   project, then review the specifications in openspec/specs/ 
   to familiarize yourself with the application architecture.
   ```

2. **Implementing Features**
   ```
   Please implement the change proposal at 
   openspec/changes/enhance-fitdoctor-features/proposal.md 
   following the tasks in tasks.md. Start with Phase 1: 
   Schema Updates.
   ```

3. **Creating New Changes**
   ```
   I want to add [FEATURE]. Please create an OpenSpec change 
   proposal following the structure in openspec/README.md.
   ```

### For Content Editors

The OpenSpec setup will help ensure:
- New features are well-documented before implementation
- Content schemas remain consistent and well-structured
- Changes are validated against project requirements
- Documentation stays up-to-date with implementations

## Next Steps

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Review the change proposal**: `openspec show enhance-fitdoctor-features`
2. **Verify project understanding**: Read `openspec/project.md`
3. **Check technical architecture**: `openspec spec show technical-architecture`

### Implementation Workflow
1. **Phase 1**: Begin schema updates (Person, Article, new sections)
2. **Phase 2**: Build new components (profiles, sections, forms)
3. **Phase 3**: Add SEO enhancements and optimizations
4. **Phase 4**: Integration testing and accessibility audit
5. **Phase 5**: Documentation and deployment

### Working with AI Assistants
Use prompts like:
- "Review openspec/changes/enhance-fitdoctor-features/tasks.md and implement the first unchecked task"
- "Create a Sanity schema for the Stats Counter section as described in the change proposal"
- "Build the ProfessionalProfile component according to the requirements"
- "Add JSON-LD structured data for articles as specified in the delta specs"
