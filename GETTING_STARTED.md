## üíª Development Workflow

### Working with AI Assistants

#### Claude Code (Configured ‚úÖ)
```
Please read openspec/project.md and familiarize yourself 
with the FitDoctor project. Then review the change proposal 
at openspec/changes/enhance-fitdoctor-features/proposal.md
```

#### Cursor / Other IDEs
```
Please read the following files to understand the project:
1. openspec/project.md - Project context
2. openspec/specs/fitdoctor-web-app/spec.md - Application spec
3. openspec/changes/enhance-fitdoctor-features/proposal.md - Current changes
```

### Implementation Flow

#### Step 1: Choose a Task
```bash
# View all tasks
cat openspec/changes/enhance-fitdoctor-features/tasks.md

# Start with Phase 1: Schema Updates
# Pick the first unchecked task
```

#### Step 2: Ask AI to Implement
```
Please implement the first task from Phase 1 in 
openspec/changes/enhance-fitdoctor-features/tasks.md:
"Add specialties array field to Person schema"

Follow the requirements in the delta specification at
openspec/changes/enhance-fitdoctor-features/specs/fitdoctor-web-app/spec.md
```

#### Step 3: Test the Implementation
```bash
# For schema changes
cd studio
npm run extract-types

cd ../nextjs-app
npm run typegen
npm run build

# Test locally
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:3333 (Sanity Studio)
```

#### Step 4: Update Task Checklist
```bash
# Mark the task as complete in tasks.md
# Change [ ] to [x] for completed tasks
```

#### Step 5: Commit Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add specialties field to Person schema"
git push
```

### Repeat for Each Task
Continue with each task in the checklist, implementing one feature at a time.

## üìö Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Understanding the Project
**Goal**: Get AI to understand the project before making changes

**Prompt**:
```
Please read and summarize the following:
1. openspec/project.md - What is the purpose and tech stack?
2. openspec/specs/fitdoctor-web-app/spec.md - What are the core features?
3. openspec/specs/technical-architecture/spec.md - How is it architected?
```

### Scenario 2: Implementing Schema Changes
**Goal**: Update Sanity schemas with new fields

**Prompt**:
```
Please implement the Person schema enhancements from 
openspec/changes/enhance-fitdoctor-features/tasks.md:

1. Add specialties array field to Person schema
2. Add certifications array field
3. Add availability/scheduling field
4. Add booking link URL field

Follow the requirements in the delta specification and 
maintain consistency with existing schema patterns.
```

### Scenario 3: Creating New Components
**Goal**: Build React components for new features

**Prompt**:
```
Please create the StatsCounter component as described in:
- openspec/changes/enhance-fitdoctor-features/proposal.md

as specified in the "Enhanced SEO Implementation" requirement 
of the delta specification.

The structured data should include:
- Article schema with author, datePublished, dateModified
- Image metadata
- ArticleBody content
- Validation against schema.org
```

### Scenario 5: Testing Changes
**Goal**: Verify implementation meets requirements

**Prompt**:
```
Please review the implementation of [FEATURE] against the 
requirements in openspec/changes/enhance-fitdoctor-features/
specs/fitdoctor-web-app/spec.md
