## Implementation Notes

### Technical Considerations
- All new components must be built using TypeScript with strict mode
- Radix UI should be used for accessible component primitives
- Form validation should use a library like Zod or React Hook Form
- All images must use next/image for optimization
- GROQ queries should be optimized to fetch only required fields

### Testing Requirements
- Each new feature must be tested on mobile devices
- Cross-browser testing required (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Accessibility testing with keyboard and screen reader
- Performance testing with Lighthouse
- Form submissions must be tested end-to-end

### Migration Strategy
- Existing content should not break when adding new schemas
- New fields should be optional to avoid breaking existing documents
- Type generation must run successfully before deployment
- Preview environment should be tested before production deployment
